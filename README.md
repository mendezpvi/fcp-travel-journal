# My Travel Journal

## *Overview* 🌟

This project is part of the React Basics module in the [**Frontend Career Path**](https://scrimba.com/the-frontend-developer-career-path-c0j) course by [**Scrimba**](https://scrimba.com/home).

During the development process, we built a static webpage using React components to practice the fundamental concepts of this library. This project helped me better understand how to create reusable and well-organized interfaces.
